Mongoid::Ids-Ng
============

A fork of [nofxx's excellent fork](https://github.com/nofxx/mongoid-ids) of 
[thetron's excellent gem](https://github.com/thetron/mongoid_token).  Updated to remove deprecated 
`alias_method_chain` calls, the solution for which I ripped off from 
[ritxi's other excellent fork](https://github.com/ritxi/mongoid_token).

## Mongoid::Token || Mongoid::Ids || Mongoid::Ids-Ng

This gem is a fork that changes the original behaviour of Mongoid::Token:
Instead of a custom field it changes the `_id` field by default.
And you may still use tokens on custom fields.


## Short snappy token ids for Mongoid documents

This library is a quick and simple way to generate unique, random ids
for your mongoid documents, in the cases where you can't, or don't want
to use slugs, or the default MongoDB ObjectIDs.

Mongoid::Ids can help turn this:

Into something more like this:

    http://bestappever.com/video/8tmQ9p


## Getting started

In your gemfile, add:

    gem 'mongoid-ids'

In your Mongoid documents, just add `include Mongoid::Ids` and the
`token` method will take care of all the setup, like so:

```ruby
class Person
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Ids

  field :name

  token
end

```

And that's it! There's lots of configuration options too - which are all
listed [below](#configuration). By default, the `token` method will
create tokens 4 characters long, containing random alphanumeric characters.

**Notice: Every Mongoid overriding has been removed (#find and #to_param).**


## Custom/Extra fields


```ruby
class Person
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Ids

  field :name

  token :code
  token :token
  token :other_code
end

```

__Note on custom field:__ Mongoid::Ids leverages Mongoid's 'safe mode' by
automatically creating a unique index on your documents using the token
field. In order to take advantage of this feature (and ensure that your
documents always have unique tokens) remember to create your indexes.
Also, `Mongoid::Ids` will never override `to_param`.


## Finders

`Mongoid::Ids` will **never** override `find`.
There's some helpers for custom fields:

```ruby
Video.find_by_code("x3v98")
Account.find_by_token("ACC-123456")
```

You can disable these with the
[`skip_finders` configuration option](#skip-finders-skip_finders).


## Configuration

You may choose between two different systems for how your tokens look:

For simple setup, you can use combination of the
[`length`](#length-length) and [`contains`](#contains-contains),
which modify the length and types of characters to use.

For when you need to generate more complex tokens, you can use the
[`pattern`](#patterns-pattern) option, which allows for very low-level
control of the precise structure of your tokens, as well as allowing
for static strings, like prefixes, infixes or suffixes.

#### Length (`:length`)

This one is easy, it's just an integer.

__Example:__

```ruby
token length: 8  # Tokens are now of length 8
token length: 12 # Whow, whow, whow. Slow down egghead.
```

You get the idea.

The only caveat here is that if used in combination with the
`:contains => :numeric` option, tokens may vary in length _up to_ the
specified length.

#### Contains (`:contains`)

Contains has 7 different options:

* `:alphanumeric` - contains uppercase & lowercase characters, as well
as numbers
* `:alpha` - contains only uppercase & lowercase characters
* `:alpha_upper` - contains only uppercase letters
* `:alpha_lower` - contains only lowercase letters
* `:numeric` - integer, length may be shorter than `:length`
* `:fixed_numeric` - integer, but will always be of length `:length`
* `:fixed_numeric_no_leading_zeros` - same as `:fixed_numeric`, but will
never start with zeros

__Examples:__
```ruby
token contains: :alpha_upper, length: 8
token contains: :fixed_numeric
```

#### Patterns (`:pattern`)

Patterns allow you fine-grained control over how your tokens look.
It's great for generating random data that has a requirements to
also have some basic structure. If you use the `:pattern` option,
it will override both the `:length` and `:contains` options.

This was designed to operate in a similar way to something like `strftime`,
if the syntax offends you - please open an issue, I'd love to get some
feedback here and better refine how these are generated.

Any characters in the string are treated as static, except those that are
proceeded by a `%`. Those special characters represent a single, randomly
generated character, and are as follows:

* `%s` - any uppercase, lowercase, or numeric character
* `%w` - any uppercase, or lowercase character
* `%c` - any lowercase character
* `%C` - any uppercase character
* `%d` - any digit
* `%D` - any non-zero digit

__Example:__

```ruby
token pattern: "PRE-%C%C-%d%d%d%d" # Generates something like: 'PRE-ND-3485'
```

You can also add a repetition modifier, which can help improve readability on
more complex patterns. You simply add any integer after the letter.

__Examples:__

```ruby
token pattern: "APP-%d6" # Generates something like; "APP-638924"
```

### Field Name

This allows you to change the field name used by `Mongoid::Ids`
This is particularly handy to use multiple tokens one a single document.

__Examples:__
```ruby
token length: 6
token :sharing_token, length: 12
token :yet_another
```


### Skip Finders (`:skip_finders`)

This will prevent the gem from creating the customised finders and
overrides for the default `find` behaviour used by Mongoid.

__Example:__
```ruby
token skip_finders: true
```


### Retry Count (`:retry_count`)

In the event of a token collision, this gem will attempt to try three
more times before raising a `Mongoid::Ids::CollisionRetriesExceeded`
error. If you're wanting it to try harder, or less hard, then this
option is for you.

__Examples:__
```ruby
token retry_count: 9
token retry_count: 0
```
